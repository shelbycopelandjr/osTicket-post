</p>
<p>
Roles are for designating a title and a set of priveleges necessary for whoever needs to do whatever. In other words, a person in a specific Role has all the abilities deemed necessary for that Role.
</p>
<p>
While in the Admin Panel, you can create new roles by selecting the Agents *TAB*, selecting the Roles section, and clicking the Add New Role button. First, you name your role. Then, you decide what it has the ability to do. It may be best, if starting from scratch, to create a role for your account that can do absolutely everything.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Create a department</h3>

</p>
<p>
Departments are used to make sure tickets of a specific variety can be sent to the department responsible for satisfying that ticket's conditions.
</p>
<p>
While in the Admin panel, you can create new departments by selecting the Agents *TAB*, selecting the Departments section, and clicking the Add New Department button. In this space, you can name your department, set it's status, determine Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and much more.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Create a team</h3>

</p>
<p>
Teams are for smaller groups within a department that only apply to certain agents within that department. For example, there may be many members in the IT department, but only a select few are chosen to be System Admins or Level III support.
</p>
<p>
To create a Team, while in the admin panel, select the Agents *TAB*, the Teams section and click the Add New Team button. In here, you can designate a name for the team, the team lead, and the agents that you choose for that specific team.
</p>
